## My Role

I was responsible for the **complete asset creation**, including modeling, texturing, lighting and rendering.

- High-detail polygonal modeling in Autodesk Maya
- PBR material creation for realistic surface properties (Hypershade)
- Lighting and rendering setup using a 3-point lighting system (Arnold)
