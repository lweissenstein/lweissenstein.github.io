**BioTopia** is a serious urban simulation game developed in collaboration with  
**Food4Future (f4f)** and the **Leibniz Institute for Vegetable and Ornamental Crops (IGZ)**.

The game explores future food production under conditions of limited space, water scarcity, and disrupted trade. Players design and manage compact **urban biospaces** to sustain a growing population using alternative food sources.

## My Role & Contributions

I worked primarily as an **Environment 3D Artist and Technical Artist**, bridging the gap between visual design and technical implementation in Unity.

- 3D environment modeling & asset creation
- Asset optimization & mobile performance tuning
- Material and shader setup in Unity
- Visual consistency across assets from multiple contributors
- Gameplay & systems design collaboration

## Gameplay & Systems

BioTopia is a **city management simulation** focused on _systems_, not city layout.  
Players must carefully allocate limited space while balancing research, resources, and population needs.

Key gameplay elements include:

- Modular urban biospaces for food production
- Procedural city growth increasing spatial pressure
- Research-driven progression based on real-world data
- Alternative food sources (algae, insects, halophytes, jellyfish)

## Technical Focus & Challenges

A major challenge was **porting a PC prototype to mobile and tablet devices** while preserving visual quality.

Key technical learnings:

- Optimizing materials, shaders, and poly-counts for mobile GPUs
- Establishing a clean asset pipeline for multi-artist collaboration
- Translating scientific research into intuitive, playable systems
