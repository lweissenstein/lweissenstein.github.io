**BioTopia** is a serious urban simulation game developed in collaboration with **Food4Future (f4f)** and the **Leibniz-Institut fuer Gemuese- und Zierpflanzenbau (IGZ)**.

The game explores future food production under conditions of limited space, water scarcity, and disrupted trade. Players design and manage compact **urban biospaces** to sustain a growing population using alternative food sources.

**Developer:** Team Project / Lennart Weissenstein  
**Role:** Environment 3D Artist, Tech Artist, Game Designer

## Context & Scope

BioTopia is a university team-project developed in collaboration with partners.

- Created with [Food4Future (f4f)](https://www.food4future.de/en/home) and the [Leibniz Institute (IGZ)](https://igzev.de/)
- Implements scientific research into future food production systems
- Expanded from a PC prototype to mobile and tablet platforms

## My Role

I worked primarily as an **Environment 3D Artist and Technical Artist**, bridging the gap between visual design and technical implementation in Unity.

- 3D environment modeling & asset creation in Maya
- Asset optimization & mobile performance tuning
- Material and shader setup in Unity
- Visual consistency across assets from multiple contributors
- Gameplay & systems design collaboration

## Gameplay

BioTopia is a **city management simulation** focused on _systems_, not city layout. Players must carefully allocate limited space while balancing research, resources, and population needs.

Key gameplay elements include:

- Managing shrinking land as the city and population grow
- Allocating and optimizing food sources to meet population needs
- Rreal-world research translated into the game
- Building compartments for alternative food sources in underused spaces like basements or rooftops

## Technical Challenges

A major challenge was **collaborating as a team under deadlines with external research partners**, integrating their scientific input while implementing our own gameplay and design ideas.

My key technical learnings:

- Creating and optimizing 3D assets for mobile and tablet platforms, keeping poly counts low while maintaining visual quality
- Adjusting and unifying models from multiple contributors for consistent style and performance
- Working closely with research insights to support educational and gameplay objectives
