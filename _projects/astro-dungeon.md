**Astro Dungeon** is a 2D endless top-down shooter where you play as a stranded astronaut defending against waves of alien enemies.  
Players navigate procedurally generated arenas, collect power-ups, and aim strategically to survive as long as possible.

## Gameplay & Systems

Astro Dungeon emphasizes **skill, strategy, and fast reflexes** rather than level layout.

Key gameplay elements include:

- Endless top-down shooter with progressively harder waves
- Mouse-aimed shooting with rotating gun visuals
- Tilemap-based arenas for structured encounters
- Variety of enemies and strategic power-ups
- Local highscore system to track best performances
- Pause menu, simple UI, and audio integration

- Custom **shader effects** for power-ups
- Balancing gameplay difficulty and progression
- Creating a visually appealing, cohesive style with minimal performance cost
- Managing input, feedback, and responsiveness for the player
